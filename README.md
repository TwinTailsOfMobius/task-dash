# Task Tracker

## Overview

The **Task Tracker** is a simple yet powerful web application designed to help you manage your tasks effectively. With a clean and intuitive interface, you can add, view, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. This project is built using Node.js for the backend and a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Quickly add tasks with a simple input form.
- **View Tasks**: All tasks are displayed in a clear list format.
- **Edit Tasks**: Update the details of any task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Mark as Completed**: Easily check off tasks as they are completed.
- **Real-time Updates**: The task list updates in real-time as you add, edit, or delete tasks.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Backend**: Powered by Node.js and Express, the backend provides a RESTful API for task management.
- **Frontend**: A user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that interacts with the backend API.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the Task Tracker application on your local machine.

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-tracker.git
   cd task-tracker/task-tracker-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ../task-tracker-frontend
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your web browser**:
   - Simply double-click the `index.html` file, or right-click and choose "Open with" your preferred browser.

   The frontend will be served locally, and it will interact with the backend server you started earlier.

## Usage

1. **Add Tasks**: Use the input field to type your task and click "Add Task."
2. **View Tasks**: All your tasks will be displayed in a list below the input form.
3. **Edit Tasks**: Not available directly on the frontend, but you can modify the task text and completion status by interacting with the backend API.
4. **Delete Tasks**: Click the "Delete" button next to any task to remove it.
5. **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Check the box next to a task to mark it as done, and it will be crossed off the list.

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following RESTful API endpoints:

- `GET /tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.
- `POST /tasks`: Add a new task.
- `PUT /tasks/:id`: Update an existing task.
- `DELETE /tasks/:id`: Delete a task.

### Example API Request

**Add a new task**:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Learn Node.js"}'
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "text": "Learn Node.js",
  "completed": false
}
```
